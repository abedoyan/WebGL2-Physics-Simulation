# WebGL2-Physics-Simulation

A particle dynamics simulation of spheres bouncing inside an invisble box. Each sphere is generated with a random color, size, mass, velocity, and location. The spheres are affected by gravity and drag. Additionally, when the spheres hit the walls of the invisible bounding box, they bounce back in the opposite direction. When the spheres collide with each other, they bounce relative to their speed, direction, and mass.
